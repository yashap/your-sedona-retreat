Casa Ananda is located in West Sedona a few blocks from beautiful hiking trails and parklands and only minutes from restaurants and shops.  Enjoy the spectacular rooftop deck view, where you can watch the morning rays gently illumine world famous Coffeepot Rock, Thunder Mountain, and Chimney Rock.</p>
                    
                    <p>Casa Ananda retreat offers you an intimate “local” experience of Sedona away from the busy, tourist-y hotels.  Casa Ananda is located in a quiet residential area of West Sedona, so you can deeply immerse yourself in the beauty and healing power that is Red Rock Country.</p>
                    
                    <p>Casa Ananda is designed to support your physical well-being by providing you with a healthy, green environment, including water filtration throughout the Casa, non-toxic paint, and formaldehyde-free materials.</p>

                    <p>You can rent Casa Ananda for $160 per night or combine it with various options: guided hiking,  Meditation Classes, or enjoy Halotherapy in the Salt Cabin.</p>
 
                    <p>Settle in and find the true heart of Sedona, you’ll find your own self.</p>

                    <p><em>“As an Arizona native, I have been drawn to visit Sedona many times.  Being in Katie's casita, tucked away in one of Sedona's sweetest areas, finally gave me the experience I had been longing for.  I plan to return often! I felt reinvigorated, and felt the special energy of the surrounding countryside in a way I had never felt it before.”</em>
